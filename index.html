                    I am a computational neuroscientist studying the dynamics and information processing properties of neuronal networks. In my group we are investigating
                    <br>
                    <br> What role do the network connectivity and network dynamics play in the transfer of information from one network to another, how neuronal and synapse properties interact with network structure to shape the network activity dynamics
                    how the activity dynamics of the network and information transfer can be controlled by external stimulation.
                    <br>
                    <br> To this end we use analytical methods from statistical mechanics, probability theory, graph theory and control systems theory, and combine them with numerical simulations of large-scale neuronal networks of different brain regions.
                    The overall goal of this line of work is to develop mathematical models of brain diseases and create a theoretical framework to understand the mechanisms underlying the emergence of disease related aberrant activity dynamics in diseases
                    (e.g. Parkinson's diseases, epilepsy, anxiety). Eventually such a quantitive understanding of brain diseases would pave the way for the development of novel brain stimulation protocols to control or correct the disease-related brain
                    activity. To this end, we are also neuralizing the control system theory and developing tools to control the dynamics of neuronal networks by external stimulations methods.

                    <br> Before moving to the KTH, I was a group leader at the Bernstein Center Freiburg, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Germany. I did my post-doctoral training with Prof. Mayank Mehta when he was at the Brown University,
                    Providence, RI. I did my PhD in computational neuroscience at the University of Freiburg, under the supervision of Prof. Ad Aertsen and Prof. Stefan Rotter. I am still associated with the Bernstein Center Freiburg and the University
                    of Freiburg, Germany.
                    <br>
                    <br> At some point I studied Communication Engineering and then Control Systems. In my spare time I analyze statistics of Cricket games and DNA sequences. And I play Cricket.
