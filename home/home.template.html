  We are interested in the dynamics of brain and how biological neuronal networks process information. Currently we are exploring the following questions:
  <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li>What role do the network connectivity and network dynamics play in the transfer of information from one network to another?</li>
    <li>How neuronal and synapse properties interact with network structure to shape the network activity dynamics?</li>
    <li>How the activity dynamics of the network and information transfer can be controlled by external stimulation?</li>
  </ul>
  <br> To this end we use analytical methods from statistical mechanics, probability theory, graph theory and control systems theory, and combine them with numerical simulations of large-scale neuronal networks of different brain regions.</br>
  <br> One of the goals of our research is to develop mathematical models of brain diseases and create a theoretical framework to understand the mechanisms underlying the emergence of disease related aberrant activity dynamics in diseases
  (e.g. Parkinson's diseases, epilepsy, anxiety). Eventually such a quantitive understanding of brain diseases would pave the way for the development of novel brain stimulation protocols to control or correct the disease-related brain
  activity. To this end, we are also neuralizing the control system theory and developing tools to control the dynamics of neuronal networks by external stimulations methods.
