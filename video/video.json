    "description" : "What is the brain's connectome useful for? Connectivity Structure and Activity Dynamics Relationship for Networks in the Brain. In this talk I briefly review some important features of brain connectivity. I argue that mind and brain are different and we cannot learn about the function of a network by just knowing its connectome. Then what is connectome good for? I show that knowing the connectome can help us understand brain dynamics. I explain why it is important to study brain dynamics. Finally, I show which features of brain connectivity are crucial for the activity dynamics. The results contribute to the fundamental problem of how network structure shape brain activity."
